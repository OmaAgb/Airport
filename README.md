Instructions
---------

* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own.
* Keep it SIMPLE - it's not nearly as complicated as it first may look.
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning
* Use your own test framework and evidence your test-driven development
* Please write your own README detailing how to install your project, how to run the tests, how you approached the problem and provide screenshots of interacting with your program.
* Please create separate files for every class, module and test suite.

Steps
-------

1. Fork this repo, and clone to your local machine
2. `npm install` to install project dependencies
3. Complete the following task:

Task
-----

We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.  Here are the user stories that we worked out in collaboration with the client:

#### Acceptance Criteria
```
As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct the airport to land a plane

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination
I want to instruct the airport to let a plane take off and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

As an air traffic controller
To avoid confusion
I want to prevent asking the airport to let planes take-off which are not at the airport, or land a plane that's already landed
```

#### Extended Acceptance Criteria
```
####
As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller
To count planes easily
Planes that have landed must be at an airport
```

Your task is to test drive the creation of a set of classes/objects to satisfy all the above user stories. You will need to use a random number generator to set the weather (it is normally sunny but on rare occasions it may be stormy). In your tests, you'll need to stub random behaviour to ensure consistent test behaviour.
